*Simple to-do app*

As an ultra beginner in React,I made this simple todo app.
I used React Hooks (useState), onClick, onChange events, also React Icons library for icons 'delete' and 'checkbox'.
There is an input field where user types todo item,and pressing button it apears down below. Todo item can be deleted and crossed (if todo is done).
